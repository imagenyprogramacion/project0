*Eurotrip*
Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

In this project I want to show the trip to Europe I've made.
The itinerary, the cities and hostels I've stayed in and tips for the travelers.
Also, I want to show pictures, and a map with the travel.

*Pages:*
//Index => On this page I'll show a brief about the trip, and what should expect the visitor.
          Must talk about the Eurail pass, it was essential for doing this trip.
//Itinerary => Embed map with the route I've made
//Highlights => Top 10 of each city's activities or places to visit.
//Hostels => Table with the hostel names, website, pros and contras
//Contact => A form where visitors can leave a message and ask questions about my trip
